/* A single food is an indivisible food with its own inherent nutrition
 * information. In this case "indivisible" does not necessarily mean that it is
 * a raw agricultural product (e.g. an apple), but simply that no breakdown of
 * this food into other foods is known to the user. So commercially-produced
 * foods which have USDA nutrition labels, and for which the user obviously
 * cannot know the exact amounts or nature of their ingredients (e.g. a can of
 * Progresso minestrone soup or a McDonald's Big Mac) are considered single
 * foods. This is in contrast to home-made foods where there is no such
 * unified nutrition label, but the ingredients are known; those are composite
 * foods.
 *
 * The database is pre-populated with many single foods available from the
 * public USDA nutrition database. It is expected that the user will enter
 * additional single foods by transcribing the nutrition labels from
 * commercially-produced foods that they consume.
 *
 * Each food has a unique ID, a name (which need not be unique, but should be,
 * since the GUI will only display the name, and not the ID), a set of nutrient
 * amounts, a group, and a source. The source is USDA (if it came from the USDA
 * public database), Import (if it was brought in from a third-party database),
 * or Custom if the user transcribed the nutrition label directly into the
 * tracker.
