/* A FoodComponent is a uniquely-identified, ordered component of a
 * particular FoodCollection. Rather than storing FoodAmount objects,
 * FoodCollections store FoodComponents which contain meta-data about ordering
 * and a unique identifier, used to disambiguate similar components.
 *
 * For example, it's entirely legal for a single food collection to contain
 * three components which are all "50g of flour". The unique identifier makes
 * it possible to specify that the second "50g of flour" should be removed,
 * not the first, and not the third. This is important in terms of the GUI
 * when the user might be clicking on a component to delete it. The user expects
 * the component under his or her cursor to be deleted, not an identical-looking
 * component elsewhere in the collection, even if the two operations are in all
 * other ways equivalent.
 *
 * FoodComponent objects are also useful because they contain a pointer back to
 * the collection that they are a part of. That way, a FoodComponent object
 * can be, for example, removed from its collection without having to maintain
 * an external association between components and collections everywhere that
 * this sort of lookup might be needed.
