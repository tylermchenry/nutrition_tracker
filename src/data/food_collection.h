/* A FoodCollection is an arbitrary collection of single and composite foods
 * which is not necessarily treated logically as its own first-class food
 * (but classes derived from FoodCollection may be treated this way).
 *
 * This class centralizes code dealing with management of the "components" that
 * make up the collection. This logic is common to "raw" collections (objects
 * of dynamic type FoodCollection), meals, and composite foods (which both
 * derive from FoodCollection).
 *
 * This class can compute and return the combined nutrient amounts for all
 * components.
 *
 * Additionally, this class keeps track of removed components (for use by
 * database-backed derived classes later, for DELETE queries), and takes care
 * of generating temporary identifiers for components that are newly added
 * and not yet in the database. When such a component is inserted into the
 * database, the derived class' saveToDatabase method is expected to notify
 * the FoodCollection parent class so that it can update its mapping of
 * previously-used temporary IDs to actual IDs. This mapping is maintained
 * in case external code passes in (e.g. to removeComponent()) a component
 * object that is still carrying the now-defunct temporary ID.
