/* A CompositeFood is a food made up of one or more other foods, which
 * functions logically as a its own food (as opposed to a FoodCollection, which
 * does not logically function in this way).
 *
 * The composite food class is the realization of the idea of a food made from a
 * recipe. The recipe calls for some number of other foods, some of which may
 * be raw or pre-packaged with USDA nutrition data available, and some of which
 * may themselves be composite foods that were prepared previously. The
 * rationale behind the composite food concept is that it makes much more sense
 * for a user to be able to enter "home-made blueberry bread" as a food into
 * the tracker rather than entering separately "flour", "salt", "baking soda",
 * "sugar", "eggs", "blueberries", etc, because when the user consumes the
 * bread, he or she is thinking about it in terms of being a single food, not
 * in terms of a collection of its individual ingredients.
 *
 * The only practical difference between a CompositeFood object and a
 * FoodCollection object is that CompositeFood objects are database-backed,
 * whereas pure FoodCollection objects are by definition temporary.
 *
 * Note that CompositeFoods are restricted to containing SingleFoods and other
 * CompositeFoods. There's nothing in the code that will prevent the illogical
 * insertion of a Meal or a FoodCollection into a CompositeFood, but such
 * objects cannot be saved to the database, and so will not be persisted.
