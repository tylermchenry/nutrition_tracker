/* FoodAmount is an Amount where the substance is a Food. Remember that here,
 * Food is the base class of all objects describing edible things including
 * collections, meals, and composite foods, as well as single foods.
 *
 * In addition to the features of the Amount class, the FoodAmount class
 * provides facilities for obtaining scaled measurements of the nutrients and
 * components of the described food. The nutrients and components of a food
 * are recorded in the database (and in the Food-derived object) in terms of
 * the food's "base amount" in a particular dimension. The scaled accessor
 * functions will scale the nutrients and components of the food in proportion
 * to the ratio between the FoodAmount and the food's base amount.
 *
 * For example, if Food A with a base amount of 100g contains 80 Calories, then
 * a FoodAmount describing 50g of Food A should report in its scaled nutrients
 * that this amount of Food A contains 40 Calories.
 *
 * Similarly, if Food B, a composite food with a base amount of 2 Cups contains
 * 1 tsp of vanilla extract as a component, then a FoodAmount describing 3 Cups
 * of Food B should report in its scaled components that this amount of Food B
 * contains 1.5 tsp of vanilla extract.
