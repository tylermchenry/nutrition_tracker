/* A meal is a a collection of foods associated with a unique triplet of
 * (meal ID, user, date). A meal ID refers to a particular named meal, e.g.
 * "Breakfast", "Lunch", "Dinner", or other user-defined identifiers. There may
 * be up to one meal of each type per user per day stored in the database.
 *
 * A Meal object may be either database-backed or temporary. A temporary meal
 * may not be saved to the database; it must instead be merged into a database-
 * backed meal, if it needs to be saved. The purpose of a temporary meal is
 * for "staging" creation of or additions to meals, so the user can experiment
 * with different foods in a meal without operating on the live database.
 *
 * It may be slightly confusing that a Meal object has a userId and a
 * creatorUserId. The former describes the user who ate the specific meal
 * described by the object, while the latter describes the user who created the
 * meal. The creatorUserId will be 0 if the meal is a standard pre-set meal
 * like Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner, and will usually match the userId if it is
 * a custom meal, but this distinction allows for future expansion.
