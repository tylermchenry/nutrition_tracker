/* A unit object represents a unit of measurement such as a gram, a fluid ounce,
 * a serving, or a kilocalorie.
 *
 * Each unit has a name and an abbreviation. The abbreviation is unique, and
 * functions as the unique identifier of the unit. Names are not necessarily
 * unique (in terms of database constraints), but obviously they logically ought
 * to be.
 *
 * Units of the same dimension can compute conversion factors between one
 * another, so that an Amount object denominated in a given unit can be easily
 * converted to be denominated in any other unit of the same dimension. E.g. you
 * could convert an Amount of 1.2 lbs to 544.31 g, but you couldn't convert
 * 1.2 lbs to Liters, servings, or kilocalories since those units describe
 * completely different dimensions, and the conversion would require more
 * information than just the units involved.
 *
 * Each dimension has a "base unit", and each unit object contains a conversion
 * factor for converting to the base unit. Conversion factors between two units
 * X and Y are computed by multiplying the X->Base conversion factor by the
 * Base->Y conversion factor (which is the inverse of the Y->Base factor). Base
 * units are arbitrary, but were chosen to be gram and fluid ounce for weight
 * and volume in order to minimize the magnitude of the conversion factors.
 *
 * The Weight, Volume, and Energy dimensions are self-explanatory. The IU
 * dimension is used for some vitamins. It is really a weight dimension, but its
 * meaning is defined in terms of the vitamin it is describing, so it isn't
 * possible to convert IU to grams, since one would need to know "IU of what?",
 * so IU and weight need to be separate dimensions to prevent this conversion.
 * The Serving dimension has only one unit, the serving, which describes the
 * serving size (either USDA-defined or user-defined) of a particular food. The
 * Quantity dimension is for discrete, countable foods, e.g. there might be
 * nutrition data for a Quantity of 28 almonds, but it wouldn't make sense to
 * describe a Quantity of milk, since amounts of milk are continuous (you would
 * instead describe a Volume, Weight, or Serving of milk).
