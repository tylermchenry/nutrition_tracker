/* A nutrient object describes a particular sort of nutrient that may be found
 * in a food. Nutrients are divided into several categories, mainly for display
 * purposes. All nutrients function in the same way.
 *
 * Each nutrient has a unique ID, a name, a category, and a standard unit. The
 * standard unit is the unit (usually of weight) in which a food's contained
 * amount of this nutrient is described. E.g. for Protein, this is grams, but
 * for Vitamin A it is IU, and for Calories it is kilocalories. In the database,
 * all single food entries simply store the numeric amount of each nutrient that
 * they contain, and the unit for the amount is implied to be the standard unit
 * for that nutrient. So it is impossible for nutrient amounts to be stored in
 * the database in anything other than their standard unit.
 *
 * Some nutrients also have a USDA reference daily intake (RDI), which is a
 * numeric amount in terms of the standard unit that the USDA recommends an
 * average person consume in a given day. For nutrients that do not have RDIs
 * defined by the USDA, this value will be 0.
