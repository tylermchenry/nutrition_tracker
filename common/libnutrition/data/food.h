/* The Food class is the parent class for all edible objects: single foods,
 * composite foods, collections, and meals. The concept of the Food class is
 * very basic: something that can be eaten.
 *
 * Something that can be eaten has a collection of nutrients that it contains,
 * and if it is made up of more than one thing, it has components that make it
 * up. Each Food also has a name and a unique identification string used for
 * quick comparisons.
 *
 * All Foods have a "base amount" that defines the amount of the food that its
 * collection of nutrients describes. A food may have multiple "base amounts"
 * for multiple dimensions (weight, volume, quantity, servings), but may only
 * have a single base amount for each dimension. The getBaseAmount() accessor
 * returns a FoodAmount object with the special property that the FoodAmount's
 * scaled nutrients are equal to the Food's contained nutrient collection
 * (because no scaling is required).
 *
 * This is an abstract base class and cannot be instantiated.
